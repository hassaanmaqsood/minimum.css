# Minimum.css

### A minimalistic CSS for simple articles, because who needs the extra fluff?

## Quick Start

1. Link the Minimum.css stylesheet in your HTML file:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://example.com/path/to/minimum.css">
   ```

2. Apply the "article" class to your HTML content:

   ```html
   <article>
     <!-- Your content goes here -->
   </article>
   ```

3. Customize the styles based on your needs – it's as easy as stealing candy from a baby.
